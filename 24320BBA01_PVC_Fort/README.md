The connectors are designed for use with 1/2" Schedule 40 PVC. 

Filament
=========
PLA is probably too brittle.
PETG works for connectors that don't have vertical pins. For those, it's too brittle. 
ABS or ASA work for all connectors.

Recommended Print Settings
===============
For a 0.4 or 0.5 mm nozzle:
+ 4 permimeters
+ 3 top and bottom layers
+ 10% cubic infill

For connectors that have vertical pins on top and bottom, the models are printed in halves and joined with #6 x 1/2" wood screws.

CAD
===
The parts were drawn in OpenSCAD.

Notes
=====
Schedule 20 PVC should work, but will be lest robust.
Schedule 80 PVC should work, but will be overkill.
